In simple words, the stock market acts as a platform where buyers and sellers meet. Other important functions of the Stock Market are: 1. Price Discovery – The stock market enables the fair valuation of stock pricing by providing a transparent medium. The shares are priced and evaluated based on their demand and supply. If a company is expected to perform well, the demand for its share rises, and hence, the price goes up.  2. Liquidity – Stock market provides you with a 24×7 opportunity to sell or buy stocks as and when desired. This ensures easy liquidity bringing in a great deal of convenience to you as investors.  3. The habit of saving and investment – As you can invest even a small amount of money in the stock market, it enhances the practice of savings amongst the people.     4. Expansion of business – Any listed company can quickly meet the need for funds required to expand its business.  5. Provides opportunities for speculation – To ensure liquidity, stock exchange provides an opportunity for healthy speculation to its investors. The stock exchange is much needed for the economic growth of the country. By trading shares, the corporate sector can build financial corpus using which it can expand its operations or deploy the capital raised for the benefit of the company. It should not be looked upon as a place to gamble or trade; rather, it is a place to invest and let your money grow.  How Do You Make Money as a Shareholder?  When you hold a share of the company, there are mainly two types of incomes you may earn. One is the dividend income, and the other is the increase in the value of the investment. Let's understand each of these.  ● Dividend income – The profits earned by a company are either reinvested in the business or given away as a part of earnings to its shareholders. The part of the profits of a company which is given to shareholders is called dividends.\", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Investonomy The Stock Market Guide That Makes You Rich.pdf', 'page': 25})]}\n"

The fund is managed by a professional fund manager who makes decisions regarding the investment strategy and allocation based on various market conditions and the fund's objectives.\\n\\nInvestors buy units (shares) in the mutual fund, which represent their ownership in the pooled assets. The value of each unit is determined by the net asset value (NAV) of the mutual fund, which is calculated by dividing the total value of all securities in the portfolio by the number of outstanding units.\\n\\nMutual funds offer several benefits to investors, including:\\n\\n1. Diversification: Mutual funds allow investors to spread their investments across a wide range of securities, reducing risk and increasing potential returns.\\n2. Professional Management: The fund manager's expertise and experience in managing the investment portfolio can help maximize returns for the investors.\\n3. Liquidity: Mutual funds offer easy buying and selling of units through applications or transactions made at the end of the business day.\\n4. Flexibility: Mutual funds cater to various investor needs, offering different types of schemes such as equity, debt, balanced, index funds, and systematic investment plans (SIPs).\\n5. Regular income: Mutual funds provide the option for investors to receive regular income through dividends or a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) that enables periodic withdrawals from their mutual fund unit holdings.\\n\\nThere are different types of mutual funds based on their investment objectives and strategies:\\n\\n1. Equity Funds: These funds invest mainly in equities (stocks) to provide long-term capital appreciation.\\n2. Debt Funds: These funds invest primarily in debt securities like bonds, government securities, and other fixed-income instruments to generate regular income.\\n3. Balanced Funds: These funds maintain a balance between equity and debt investments to strike a balance between growth and income.\\n4. Index Funds: These funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific benchmark index by investing in the same securities in the same proportion as the index.\\n5. Sectoral or Thematic Funds: These funds invest in specific sectors or themes, such as technology, healthcare, or infrastructure.\\n\\nMutual funds are an excellent option for investors seeking to build a diversified investment portfolio and benefit from professional management while minimizing risk.\", 'source_documents': [Document(page_content='Intermediaries\\nThese persons get the form to you, help you understand the product and\\nhelp you buy the right fund.
